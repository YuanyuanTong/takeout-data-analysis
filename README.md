# takeout-data-analysis
This is a C++ program for analyzing diffrent kinds of data downloaded from Google takeout website. Currently supporting Hangouts.json and Maps MyActivity.html.
For reading json files, it depends on RapidJSON. For reading html files, it depends on RapidXML. However, to be compatible with the RapidXML parser, you have to replace all the <br> tags with <br/>s. Other parsers might be considered later. To run the code, put your "Takeout/Hangouts/Hangouts.json" and "Takeout/My Activity/Maps/MyActivity.html" under the project folder. Then modify the html file as descripted above.
